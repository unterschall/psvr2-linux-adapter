/* This is a placeholder module for handling the PSVR2 controllers via Bluetooth */
/* In a fully functional driver, this would implement Bluetooth detection and */
/* interfacing with the controllers. */

/*
 * This module would provide:
 * 1. Controller detection and pairing functionality
 * 2. Button and analog input mapping
 * 3. Haptic feedback support (if implemented by adapter)
 * 4. Adaptive trigger support (if implemented by adapter)
 */

/* 
 * Currently this is just a placeholder. The actual implementation will need:
 * - HID report descriptor for PSVR2 controllers
 * - BT connection handling code
 * - Input event mapping
 * - Haptic feedback output interface
 */

/* 
 * In a fully functional driver, we would implement functions like:
 * - psvr2_hid_probe
 * - psvr2_hid_init
 * - psvr2_hid_connect
 * - psvr2_hid_disconnect
 * - psvr2_hid_raw_event
 * - psvr2_hid_event
 */

/*
 * For now, this module is just a placeholder. Once we understand more about
 * the adapter's controller handling, this will be implemented.
